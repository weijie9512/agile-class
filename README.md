# Agile Software Development

Hello! this is my first document written in Markdown, and I am writing this for a class name Agile Software Development!

I am attaching a [link](https://www.codementor.io/npostolovski/40-side-project-ideas-for-software-engineers-g8xckyxef) here, giving 40 side project ideas for software engineers! Click on the link if you are interested! Some of the projects provide tutorials, for example, HTTP server project have a link to tutorial available on the web. Feel free to check it out! As we know, the only way to become better at coding is through more practice! I started to understand the concept pretty late.

Another interesting article that I find interesting is [article about neural networks](https://www.quantamagazine.org/foundations-built-for-a-general-theory-of-neural-networks-20190131?fbclid=IwAR1sg2n_Q26xqZHzJ-MC8aDEWkIsGSS5DPPwdR1k3DncfhWgzQr_weMY4hU). I have no knowledge of deep learning, but I think the article is interesting in the way that we do not really know what we are building until taken out for test run. I think this is the closest we are to modeling human brains.
